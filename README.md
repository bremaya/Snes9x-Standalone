# Snes9x Standalone

Snes9x (https://www.snes9x.com) is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation; which includes some real gems that were only ever released in Japan.

This is a personal project, and I'm not related with Snes9x Team (https://www.snes9x.com) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with Snes9x v1.60.
